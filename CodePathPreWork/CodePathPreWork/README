App Brainstorming

Collaborative Moodboard and Project Planner

A mobile app that combines visual inspiration with project planning for creatives (photographers, designers, artists).
Users can create collaborative moodboards by pinning images, videos, and sketches and integrate a task management system to
track project milestones. The app would also include a timeline view, comment threads for feedback, and the ability to share
boards publicly or privately.
